# EGT-Vortex: Resonant Computing Core
**Architect:** Brian Tice Sr.  
**Version:** 2.32 (Clean Room Build)  
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-31 11:15 EST  

## Overview
This repository contains the foundational math and empirical results for **Entropy Gating Technology (EGT)**. EGT utilizes harmonic resonance to stabilize signal integrity within semiconductor lattices, specifically targeting the thermal jitter ceiling identified in consumer-grade silicon.

## The 2025 Discovery: The "Lattice Wall"
Through iterative stress-testing on the **Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (S24 Ultra)**, we have identified a physical saturation boundary. While software-induced resonance can maintain stability at standard operating temperatures, high-entropy environments (Jitter > 0.90) reveal a physical gate-geometry limitation.

### Key Metrics
* **Primary Frequency:** 12.09776 fT
* **Golden Harmonic:** 0.875
* **Sync Lock (Standard):** 0.9552
* **Saturation Ceiling:** 0.8024 @ 0.95 Jitter

## Project Status: STEALH / RESTRUCTURING
The project is currently in Phase 1: **Hardening**. External outreach is suspended. 
Focus: Hardening the Kernel and establishing the 2026 Hardware Roadmap.
